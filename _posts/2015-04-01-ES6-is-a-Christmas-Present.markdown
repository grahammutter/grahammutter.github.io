### JavaScript - The Assembly Language of the Web

I don't like JavaScript. Not the ES5 specification of it, anyways. I learned everything I know about programming in C/C++ and Java, so prior to my exposure to JavaScript, OOP and type-safety was dogma.
ES5 gives you too many ways to shoot yourself in the foot, and there are 10x as many frameworks in circulation than is managable.

[This](https://xkcd.com/927/) XKCD comic sums up my sentiment of the currently available JavaScript MVC frameworks quite nicely.

Google's attempt to fix (read: replace) it with Dart was well intentioned but very few developers have actually adopted the language. Leaving the support of the JavaScript community, and all it's frameworks and libraries is a pretty big thing to ask of a dev.

TypeScript did it right, IMO. Wrapping JavaScript in a new language (strict superset) allows for this transition into a higher-level, modern language without forcing developers to abandon their beloved frameworks.

### Enter ECMAScript6

TypeScript as the new standard! Obviously there will still be the hassle of using '.d.ts' files to use old libraries, but once ES6 official released, it's only a matter of time until they are washed away in favor of ES6-native libraries.

Angular2 has already been written in ES6-compliant TypeScript and is scheduled to be released sometime this month. A framework as big as Angular is a great first step to get the ES6-adoption ball rolling.

I feel like a kid waiting for Christmas.
